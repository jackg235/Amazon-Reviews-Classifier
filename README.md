Using 100,000 reviews from Amazon.com, along with their timestamps and star ratings, this project uses textual and temporal data to predict the star ratings with 84.6% accuracy. 
This project is adapted from a CIS 545 homework at the University of Pennsylvania. All code is original, but many function descriptions are not.
